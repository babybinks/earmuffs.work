done in the background so the database is always up to date.  

To assist in
development and help improve the application, you may opt-in to allow anonymous 
usage statistics to be collected.  By default, this option is not enabled.  To opt-in
to anonymous data collection, select your preference in the systems Settings app (the gray gears icon).

We respect your privacy and appreciate the trust you place with us.  If you have
any questions please contact us at <a href='mailto:support@babybinks.com'>support@babybinks.com</a>.
